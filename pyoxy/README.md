# Pyoxy

Pyoxy is a self-contained Python distribution / Python application runner.

Pyoxy is part of the
[PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer.git) project. However,
Pyoxy is intended to be useful as a standalone project/tool and is developed as
such. However, it leverages a lot of functionality developed for the PyOxidizer
project and its canonical source repository is the aforementioned PyOxidizer
repository.
